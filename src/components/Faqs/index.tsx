  {
    question: "Is there any fee to join DaanPitara?",
    answer: "Yes, a one-time official onboarding fee of ₹2,100/- is applicable. This covers your NGO’s registration, verification, and listing on the platform. Post onboarding, you’ll gain access to our full suite of services."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after onboarding?",
    answer: "After successful onboarding, NGOs can choose from various available services, packages, or combos as per their needs. These services will be activated as per mutual discussion and will reflect in the monthly billing."
  },
  {
    question: "Are service charges fixed or negotiable?",
    answer: "There is no fixed price list displayed publicly. All pricing for services, packages, or combos is discussed and mutually decided post onboarding — based on your NGO’s goals, budget, and campaign requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "When do clients have to pay?",
    answer: "Payment is due monthly based on the services selected. Once a service is chosen and activated, it will reflect in the monthly bill. Clients are required to pay invoices promptly, regardless of campaign results, as results depend on external market factors and are not linked to billing terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Are results guaranteed with services?",
    answer: "While our team offers best-in-class digital support, all fundraising and marketing results depend on various market and donor behavior factors. Therefore, results cannot be used as a condition for payment or refund."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel a service mid-month?",
    answer: "You may request cancellation or pause of any service before the next billing cycle. However, services already activated in a billing cycle will be billed fully and must be paid accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Are payments refundable?",
    answer: "No refunds are applicable once onboarding is completed and services are activated. In exceptional cases (such as system errors or double payments), refunds may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis."
  },
  {
    question: "How can payments be made?",
    answer: "Payments can be made via UPI, bank transfer, or secure payment gateway links shared by our team."
